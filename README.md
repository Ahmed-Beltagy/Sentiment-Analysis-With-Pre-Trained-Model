# Sentiment Analysis Tutorial using nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment
This repository provides a step-by-step tutorial on performing sentiment analysis using the nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment model. Sentiment analysis is the task of determining the sentiment or emotional polarity of a given text, such as whether it is positive, negative, or neutral.

In this tutorial, we leverage the power of the nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment pre-trained model, which is based on the BERT architecture. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a state-of-the-art transformer-based model that has achieved remarkable success in various natural language processing tasks.

The tutorial covers the following key steps:

**Import Some Librarie and Dependencies**

**Tokenization and Encoding: Next, we tokenize the text data into individual tokens and convert them into numerical representations that can be understood by the BERT model.**

**Instantiate Model**: We load the nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment model using a deep learning framework such as PyTorch

Inference and Prediction: Using the loaded model, we perform inference on the preprocessed text data to predict the sentiment labels. We demonstrate how to obtain sentiment scores or probabilities associated with each sentiment category.

The tutorial provides code examples and explanations for each step, making it easy for beginners to follow along and understand the sentiment analysis process.
